# racing_game
A racing game I created using the pygames module

To run this game, please download all three files ( .py, .png, .wav) in the same directory. Use any IDLE to run the program.

PS: Requires the pygame module to be installed on your computer. This can be done by typing "pip install pygame" on your command line.
